Language-based IFC benchmark.

How to run the test cases:

1- Download ZaphodFacets from: https://github.com/taustin/ZaphodFacets.
2- Combine its code with the Narcissus JavaScript engine, which in turn requires spidermonkey jsshell.
3- run each test case by invoking ./njs -f testxx.js , where the xx is the test number.

You can contact Bassam Sayed at bassam@ece.uvic.ca if you can't get the code of the Narcissus JavaScript engine running properly.
